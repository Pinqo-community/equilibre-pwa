## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository** (if applicable): If you're contributing as an external contributor, please fork the repository. If you're part of our core team, you can work directly on the main repository.

2. **Clone the Repo**: Clone your fork (or the main repo) to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pinqo-community/mental-health-app.git
cd mental-health-app
```
3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
4. **Make Changes**: Implement your feature or bug fix.

5. **Commit your Changes**: Commit your changes with a clear and meaningful message. Please follow the conventional commit prefixes guidelines [here](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13).
```bash
git commit -m "Add a brief description of your changes"
```

## How to Contribute

1. **Open a Pull Request**: Once your changes are ready, push your branch and open a pull request (PR) against the `develop` branch.
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
- In your PR description, include a brief summary of your changes and reference any related issues (e.g., Fixes #123).

2. **Code Review**: Your PR will be reviewed by two or more team members. Be open to feedback and make any necessary changes. Once approved, your PR will be merged into the `develop` branch.

3. **Stay Updated**: Regularly pull the latest changes from the `develop` branch to keep your feature branch up to date.
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git rebase develop
```

## Branching Strategy

We use a simple branching strategy:
- **main**: The production branch. This branch contains only stable code ready for production.
- **develop**: The integration branch for new features. It contains the latest development work that will eventually be merged into `main`.
- **feature/feature-name**: Every new feature or bug fix should be developed on its own branch to keep `develop` clean. Follow this naming convention: `feature/feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-description`.

## Rebasing

To avoid conflicts during feature integration, we recommend **rebasing** your feature branch regularly with `develop`:
```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/develop
```

## Merging into Main

Once the `develop` branch is stable and all planned features are ready for production, follow these steps to merge into `main`:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge develop
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin main --tags
```

## Critical Bugs on Main

For critical bugs in production on the `main` branch, create a `hotfix` branch to quickly resolve the issue:
```bash
git checkout -b hotfix/issue-description
```
After resolving the issue, merge the `hotfix` branch into both `develop` and `main` to keep both branches up to date:
```bash
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/issue-description
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/issue-description
```
